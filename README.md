# Algorithms introduced to us in the Algorithms & Complexity lectures

Below is a list of all algorithms.
Those with a tick are implemented and tested.
Other may be implemented but lack a unit test.

Untested code may not work or compile at all - so be careful.

## Running
To run the tests execute `make test && ./test.out`.

To print the AVL Tree exercise output execute `make avl && ./avl.out`.
